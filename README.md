Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to design, develop, test and maintain software efficiently and reliably.
Is important for ensuring efficiency, reliability, scalability, maintainability, cost-effectiveness, security, user satisfaction and effective collaboration in software development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Its beginning in 1968 to solve software problems with better methods the rise of object oriented programming in the 1980s-1990s for easier and reusable coding and the Agile revolution from 2001 for faster, more flexible software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Include Planning (define goals), Requirement Analysis (gather needs), Design (create structure), Development (write code), Testing (fix bugs), Deployment (release software) and Maintenance (update and improve).

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear method where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Agile is flexible and works in small cycles with continuous feedback. Waterfall is best for fixed, clear projects like banking or government systems. Agile is best for evolving projects like mobile apps or startup products. Waterfall has minimal user involvement, while Agile involves frequent user feedback. Testing in Waterfall happens at the end but in Agile it’s continuous.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes and tests code, fixes bugs and improves software. A QA Engineer ensures software quality by testing and finding errors. A Project Manager plans, oversees progress, manages resources and ensures deadlines are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs help developers write, test and debug code easily (e.g. VS Code, IntelliJ). VCS tracks code changes and enables teamwork (e.g. Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face bugs, tight deadlines, new technology, heavy workload, communication issues and security risks. They can test code, plan well, keep learning, prioritize tasks, communicate clearly and follow security best practices to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing checks small code parts. Integration testing ensures parts work together. System testing checks full software. Acceptance testing ensures users are happy.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is creating good inputs to get the best AI responses. It is important because it improves accuracy, makes AI more useful and helps get better answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague:Tell me about history.
Improved:Summarize World War II, its causes and impact.
Specific –Focuses on World War II instead of all history.
Clear –Asks for causes and impact, guiding the AI.
Concise –keeps the request short but detailed.
